# [Friend Finder](https://friend-match-finder.herokuapp.com/)

An app the uses node, express and path, with api, ajax and routing. This app takes user data and compares it to data stored on the server and sends back the best match.

The goal of the app was to show the use of routing and manipulation of data. The app uses a javascript file since the goal wasn't to show SQL/noSQL integration.
